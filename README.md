# Genaille_Lucas_Ruler_Visualiser
A visualizer for Genaille-Lucas rulers.

Motivation: I had recently watched a VSauce youtube video about Genaille-Lucas rulers and wanted to play around with them.
I looked online for a visulaiser for the rulers, but did not find one. So I decided to make my own. This visualiser took me
a day to create. It doesn't look great, but has all the functionality I wanted.
